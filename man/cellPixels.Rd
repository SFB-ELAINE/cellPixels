\arguments{
\item{input_dir}{A character (directory that contains all images)}

\item{apotome}{A boolean (TRUE if Apotome was used)}

\item{apotome_section}{A boolean (TRUE is sectioned image shall be used)}

\item{nucleus_color}{A character (color (layer) of nuclei)}

\item{protein_in_nuc_color}{A character (color (layer) of protein
expected in nucleus)}

\item{protein_in_cytosol_color}{A character (color (layer) of protein
expected in cytosol)}

\item{protein_in_membrane_color}{A character (color (layer) of protein
expected in membrane)}

\item{number_size_factor}{A number (factor to resize numbers for
numbering nuclei)}

\item{bit_depth}{A number (bit depth of the original czi image)}

\item{number_of_pixels_at_border_to_disregard}{A number (number of pixels
at the border of the image (rows and columns) that define the region
where found cells are disregarded)}

\item{add_scale_bar}{A logic (add scale bar to all images that are saved
if true)}

\item{metadata_file}{A character (file with meta data if tifs are used)}

\item{normalize_nuclei_layer}{A boolean (state whether nucleus layer should be normalized)}

\item{magnification_objective}{A number (magnification of objective if not given in metadata or if metadata is wrong)}
}
\description{
Main function for counting pixels in different regions
}
\details{
Input should be czi or tif-format with dim(z)>=1.
We are counting the intensities of pixels of different color within and
outside of the nuclei. We also add information about the entire image.
